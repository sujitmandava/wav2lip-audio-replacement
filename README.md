# wav2lip-audio-replacement
A Python-based lip-syncing pipeline that replaces original audio in a video with new audio and syncs lip movements using Wav2Lip.


This project demonstrates an audio replacement system with accurate lip synchronization using the Wav2Lip model. It takes an input video and a new audio file, then generates an output video where the original speech is replaced with the new audio while ensuring the speaker’s lip movements match the new speech. The system maintains the original video’s identity, head movements, and visual quality for a realistic result.
